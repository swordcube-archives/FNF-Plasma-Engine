YO!!! If you're reading this:

I need you to know that YoshiCrafter29 originally made the code for updating.

I will eventually try to learn how the code actually works and probably rewrite it and make it look original.
This code (along with the code from funkin/github) was taken from Codename Engine, It's really cool and you should check it out!
